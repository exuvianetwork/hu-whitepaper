# Marketplace

At Heroes Uprising, we are aiming to provide a secure and stable security to both of your investments in our token and NFTs. The way we are implementing this complex security is through our marketplace. As for an example, the marketplace will have a previous/recent listing chart which shows how much the NFT has been bought/sold for (within a 5% margin). The marketplace listings will be bought and sold using the WETH.

Marketplace transactions being carried out will require both a buyer and a seller, wherein there will be a 4% tax charged for the given sale and will then be directed into the treasuries mentioned [here](https://docs.heroesuprising.com/game-economy-tokens-sale-and-funds-information/game-economic).
