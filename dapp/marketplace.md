# Marketplace

At Heroes Uprising, we are aiming to provide a secure and stable security to both of your investments in our token and NFTs. The way we are implementing this complex security is through our marketplace. As for an example, the marketplace will have a previous/recent listing chart which shows how much the NFT has been bought/sold for (within a 5% margin). The marketplace listings will be bought and sold using the WETH.

Marketplace transactions being carried out will require both a buyer and a seller, wherein there will be a 4% tax charged for the given sale and will then be directed into the treasuries mentioned [here](https://docs.heroesuprising.com/game-economy-tokens-sale-and-funds-information/game-economic).

### Overview

### Selling

The Heroes Uprising Marketplace is consisting of three ways to sell, these are the Buy Now, Auction, and Lend Method.

*   #### Buy Now

    The Buy Now Method is commonly the marketplace platform in a setting of Buyer and Seller. Sellers list their NFT's for the price they set and wish to sell it to buyers for. to put it simply, as a buyer is interested on the given price the listed item has, the transaction will proceed as sellers sell their NFT's and the buyers will receive them in their respective wallets or inventories.
*   #### Auction

    The Auction Method on the other hand implies an auction setting, with this you are able to set your NFT's up for Auction with a reserved price. Basically, buyers will set a bid once this hits the Heroes Uprising Marketplace. There will be an auction timer running as the auction is ongoing. If the reserved price is met, the Auction will continue until the timer ends. If the reserved price is not met, the auction will cease and will be considered void. NFT's or Items will be returned to respective Inventories.
*   #### Lend

    if you want to consider having more benefits, then you can use the Lend method. The process of lending is that when a lender list their NFT's to the market, Borrowers are able to use these given NFT's for a set of conditions. Lenders will be able to earn 60% of the borrowers earnings while the borrowers will earn only 40% from the start until the end of the lend period, costing a monthly payment until it is paid. Conditions will be set by the lender with its associated monthly payment. With this in hand, if the borrower is unable to pay for two consecutive payments, the lender will have the right to retake the NFT from their inventories.

### Buying

If you are considering on buying an NFT from the market, make sure to have prepared the requested currency the seller has set. To continue, access by simply clicking on the "buy" button from the page, confirm and check your associated wallets for any pop up confirmations regarding the transaction and check details. Once you have accepted the transaction, the purchase will be completed
