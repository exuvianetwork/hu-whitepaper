Insignia (SGN), a BEP-20 token, is the governance token for Heroes Uprising. Having insignia allows its users the ability to vote on modifications to the protocol's functioning, allowing them to have their voices heard. Staking is another way for holders to earn SGN. Insignia will be used also for purchasing normal swords and heroes.
