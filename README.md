The Land of Mydoslyne is the land of Honor, Fame, and Glory. Owned and ruled by its people, who live by the virtues of Courage, Pride, and Liberality. Known for its events, stories, and memories throughout the years.

There are different tribes in every elemental region. The Flames of Phoenetra Tribe, The Waves of Seagandia Tribe, The Great Stone of Yagamuth Tribe, The Breeze of Kuzityre Tribe, The Beam of Arkansun Tribe, and The Depth Void Tribe. Although Monsters are present in the Land of Mydoslene, the tribes go for the hunt, to provide for their needs and to keep the land safe from the evils of the depth. Nothing else feels great than being called the best warriors of the Land of Mydoslene, to be acknowledged as the fiercest, bravest, and smartest. To earn riches, glory, fame, and to earn the right to be called the greatest hero in the land of Mydoslyne. The tribes forge their swords to wield, slay monsters, and aid in their arena battles. To earn medallions, and trophies and to show who has more power in the Land of Mydoslene.
