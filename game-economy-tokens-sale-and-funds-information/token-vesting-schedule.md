# Token Vesting Schedule

Since preserving market equilibrium is a difficult task, We developed this concept as a viable solution that will benefit both our community and investors

Development : 10% unlocked Before public exchange listing and 10% quarterly

Seed : 10% Unlocked Before public exchange listing, then 10% quarterly

Private : 20% Unlocked Before public exchange listing, then 20% quarterly

Reserved: 6 months fully locked after TGE then 10% quarterly

Liquidity : 25% Unlocked Before public  exchange listing , Then 10% monthly over 5 months then 5% monthly for another 5 months (all unlocked tokens will be locked forever to the respective LP pair)

Team & Advisor: 1 year fully locked after TGE then 25% quarterly

Game Rewards: 10% unlocked before public exchange listing, then 10% quarterly

Airdrop: 10% unlocked before public exchange listing, then 5% quarterly

We've chosen this method for a variety of reasons. To keep the market pricing stable and to be fair to our private and public sale investors, as well as to safeguard everyone from a market crash.
