Seed: 10% Unlocked Before public exchange listing, then 10% quarterly

Private: 20% Unlocked Before public exchange listing, then 20% quarterly

Liquidity: 25% Unlocked Before public exchange listing, Then 10% monthly over 5 months then 5% monthly for another 5 months (all unlocked tokens will be locked for 2 years to their respective LP pair)

Game Rewards: 10% unlocked before public exchange listing, then 10% quarterly

Reserved: 6 months fully locked after TGE then 10% quarterly

Team & Advisor: 1 year fully locked after TGE then 25% quarterly

Marketing: 10% unlocked before public exchange listing, then 10% quarterly

Airdrop: 10% unlocked before public exchange listing, then 5% quarterly

We've chosen this method for a variety of reasons. To keep the market pricing stable and to be fair to our private and public sales investors, as well as to safeguard everyone from a market crash.
