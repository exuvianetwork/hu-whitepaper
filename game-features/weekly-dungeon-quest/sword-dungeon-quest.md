# Sword Dungeon Quest

Access this dungeon to have a chance to defeat a boss and receive rewards. On a specific day, entry is unlimited until the boss is defeated. The entry fee that will be used is RAP (Rare Amethyst Particle). However, unlike the Sprites Dungeon, the fee is increased with each entry. Defeating the boss will grant rewards. If the 24 hours is up, then the player loses the chance to get a reward until the next dungeon element rotation.
