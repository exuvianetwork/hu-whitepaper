# Sprites Dungeon Quest

Access this dungeon to have a chance to defeat a boss and receive rewards. On a specific day, entry is unlimited until the boss is defeated. The entry fee that will be used is RAP (Rare Amethyst Particle). The boss has a huge number of health points, so the player must keep reentering to whittle down the boss's health until it is finally defeated. Bosses change every week on a rotation basis.
