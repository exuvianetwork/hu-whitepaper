# Combine System

To reduce the number of minted swords, we'll add our Nft Burning system. Integrate

Integrate allows users to merge any swords to create a single random or pure element sword this feature will be free from transaction fees

There are two types of integration, each of which differs in terms of the user's preferred method of performing one.



### Dual Combine

You can combine 2 random sword unto 1 sword with low chance of getting pure elements and cards.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Combined unto 1 sword with 90% chance random elements and cards, 10% pure element and cards.
{% endhint %}

### Quad Combine

You can combine 4 random sword unto 1 sword with high chance of getting pure elements and cards.

{% hint style="info" %}
Combined unto 1 sword with 60% chance random elements and cards, 40% pure element and cards.
{% endhint %}
