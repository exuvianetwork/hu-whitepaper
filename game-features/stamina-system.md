# Stamina System

Stamina is the main factor on earning RAP in Heroes Uprising, once you start playing you will receive 20 stamina per day that will reset every 12:00 GMT +8. Once you enters Arena Battle Royal a Stamina will be consumed whether the player was successful or not.

The amount of Stamina you receive prevents players from earning huge amount of RAP, as it can affect our in-game economy. But you can increase your Stamina limit per day if you obtain more Swords and store it on your respective wallet.

| SWORDS OBTAIN | STAMINA LIMIT |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 3-9           | 30/30         |
| 10-19         | 40/40         |
| 20-29         | 50/50         |
| 30 - OR MORE  | 60/60         |
