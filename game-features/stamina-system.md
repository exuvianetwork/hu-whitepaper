# Stamina System

Stamina is the main factor on earning RAP in Heroes Uprising, once the players start playing they will receive 20 stamina per day that will reset every 12:00 GMT +8. Once the players enters the Arena Battle Royal a Stamina will be consumed whether the players was successful or not.

The amount of Stamina players receive prevents players from earning huge amount of RAP, as it can affect our in-game economy. But players can increase your Stamina limit per day if they obtain more Swords and store it in their respective wallet.

Players can also increase Stamina limit once they Join a guild. more info [here](https://docs.heroesuprising.com/game-features/guild-system)
