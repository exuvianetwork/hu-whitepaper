# Stamina System

Stamina is the main factor in earning RAP in Heroes Uprising. Once the players start playing, they will receive 20 stamina per day that will reset every 12:00 GMT+8. Once the players enter the arena battle royal, stamina will be consumed whether the players are successful or not.&#x20;

The amount of stamina players receive prevents them from earning a huge amount of RAP, as it can affect our in-game economy. But players can increase their stamina limit per day if they obtain more swords and store them in their respective wallets.



Players can also increase Stamina limit once they Join a guild. more info [here](https://docs.heroesuprising.com/game-features/guild-system)
