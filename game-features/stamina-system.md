# Stamina System

Stamina is the main factor on earning RAP in Heroes Uprising, once they start playing they will receive 20 stamina per day that will reset every 12:00 GMT +8. Once the players enter the Arena Battle Royal, a stamina point will be consumed whether the players were successful or not.

The amount of stamina that players receive prevents them from earning huge amount of RAP, as it can affect our in-game economy. Although players have a way to increase their stamina limit per day. They can do this by obtaining more swords and store it in their respective wallet as well as being able to join a guild. More info [here](https://docs.heroesuprising.com/game-features/guild-system)
