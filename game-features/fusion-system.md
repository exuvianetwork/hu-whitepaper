# Fusion System

## Sword Fusion

To reduce the number of minted swords, we'll add our Nft Burning system. Integrate

Integrate allows users to merge any swords to create a single random or pure element sword this feature will be free from transaction fees

There are two types of integration, each of which differs in terms of the user's preferred method of performing one.



### Dual Fusion

You can fuse 2 random sword unto 1 sword with low chance of getting pure elements and cards.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Fused unto 1 sword with 90% chance random elements and cards, 10% pure element and cards.
{% endhint %}

### Quad Fusion

You can fuse 4 random sword unto 1 sword with high chance of getting pure elements and cards.

{% hint style="info" %}
Fused unto 1 sword with 60% chance random elements and cards, 40% pure element and cards.
{% endhint %}

## Sprite Fusion

If fusion does not result in a rarity increase, then the companion you receive will be the same grade as the ones used but will have random element. The companions used for fusion will be automatically burned.
