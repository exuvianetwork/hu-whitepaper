# Burning Mechanism

We came up with three methods to burn as many inflated tokens as possible.

#### Forging

Creating new weaponry required Insignia and Rare amethyst Particle all of the tokens required will be automatically sent to the burn address hence reducing its circulating supply .

#### Heroes

Normal Heroes can be purchased with Insignia and Rare Amethyst Particle. When the marketplace launches, it will charge at least 10%  of its users as a fee, of which 5% will be liquidated and used to buy back tokens for burn, and the remaining 5% will be sent to the burn address automatically, reducing the circulating supply.&#x20;

#### Swords

Normal Swords can also be purchased with Insignia and Rare Amethyst Particles, which means that players will be charged at least a 10% fee of which also 5% will be liquidated and used to buy back tokens for burn, and the remaining 5% will be sent to the burn address automatically, reducing the circulating supply.



On this way we can always increase its demand without worrying about inflation.
