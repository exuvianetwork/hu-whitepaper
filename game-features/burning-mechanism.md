# Burning Mechanism

We came up with three methods to burn as many inflated tokens as possible.

#### Forging

Creating new weaponry required SGN and RAP all of the tokens required will be automatically sent to the burn address hence reducing the circulating supply.

#### Heroes

Normal Heroes can be purchased with SGN and RAP. When the marketplace launches, it will charge at least 4% of its users as a fee, of which if the seller list an item on the marketplace for SGN 2% of the fee will go to treasury and the other 2% will go to the seasonal prize pool. And if the seller list an item on the marketplace for RAP 2% of the fee will go to the treasury for community event rewards and the other 2% will be burned reducing the circulating supply.

#### Swords

Normal Swords can also be purchased with SGN and RAP, which means that players will be charged at least a 4% fee, of which if the seller list an item on the marketplace for SGN 2% of the fee will go to treasury and the other 2% will go to the seasonal prize pool. And if the seller list an item on the marketplace for RAP 2% of the fee will go to the treasury for community event rewards and the other 2% will be burned reducing the circulating supply.

On this way we can always increase its demand without worrying about over circulation.
