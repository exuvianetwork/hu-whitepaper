# Durability System

Each Sword NFT has its own Durability. This will indicate the players' progress in the game. Each battle players face will deduct each of the player's swords durability. Each battle will take away ONE ( 1 ) point of durability. Once it goes down to ZERO ( 0 ) Durability, players will not get any rewards despite having stamina. Don't wait for one of the heroes' swords to turn to zero. Even if the players have 2 swords that have durability left and 1 sword that has zero durability, they will not get any rewards after each battle. You need to maintain all of your swords' durability that are equipped on your heroes above zero in order to gain rewards.

### How can I replenish my Swords Durability?

Players can replenish Swords Durability by purchasing a potion that can be purchased using RAP on the marketplace. Each swords need one potion to replenish its durability to 100%.
