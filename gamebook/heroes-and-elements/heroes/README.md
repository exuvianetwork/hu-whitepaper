# Heroes

Heroes are summoned by players to assist them in their Mysdolyne journey. These summoned heroes will aid your quest, but each element has its own capabilities and weaknesses, so select your hero wisely.

{% hint style="danger" %}
You can get your Heroes by minting or purchasing one on the marketplace.

_"Minting requirements may change depending on the games economic balance."_
{% endhint %}
