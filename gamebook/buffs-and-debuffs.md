# Buffs and Debuffs

There are status affects in heroes uprising, much like in many other games. A good influence is known as "Buffs," whereas a negative effect is known as "Debuffs". They may be used on your allies or your adversaries by using Ability Cards. Heroes who are impacted by certain status effects have a floating symbol over their heads that shows which status effect is active.
