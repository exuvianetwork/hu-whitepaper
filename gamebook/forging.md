# Forging

![](../.gitbook/assets/forge.jpg)

If you want a better card combination, you can forge new weapons, exactly as in any other fantasy game. These weapons can be utilized in battle, used to make new weapons, or sold on the open market.

{% hint style="info" %}
Players can only forge their weapons five times only with every forge increasing the SGN And RAP Required
{% endhint %}

## Sword parts

Sword can be varied at 4 parts and each parts has its designated cards for the game

While forging this parts will be randomly dismantle to create a new weapon and cards combination within it.

Category of the swords element will be determined on the blade.

## **Genetics**

Swords has 4 parts, each part possesses 4 genes. A dominant (D), major recessive (R1), minor recessive (R2), and hidden recessive gene (R3). The idea comes from a well known game called Axie Infinity and Cryptokitties\
The dominant gene is what determines the part that is physically present on the Sword. When forging, each gene has a chance to be passed down to offspring:

**Dominant (D):** 37.5% chance to pass this gene to offspring.

**Recessive (R1):** 9.375% chance to pass this gene to offspring.

**Minor Recessive (R2):** 3.125% chance to pass this gene to offspring.
