# Forging System

![](../.gitbook/assets/forge.jpg)

If you want a better card combination, you can forge new weapons, exactly as in any other fantasy game. These weapons can be utilized in battle, used to make new weapons, or sold on the open market.

{% hint style="info" %}
Players can only forge their weapons five times with every forge increasing the SGN And RAP required.
{% endhint %}

## Sword Parts

Sword can be varied at 4 parts and each parts has its designated cards for the game

While forging this parts will be randomly dismantle to create a new weapon and cards combination within it.

Category of the swords element will be determined on the blade.

## **Forging Fees**

| FORGE COUNT | Forge Number | RAP | SGN |
| ----------- | ------------ | --- | --- |
| **0/5**     | 1            | 750 | 1   |
| 1/5         | 2            | 600 | 1   |
| 2/5         | 3            | 450 | 1   |
| 3/5         | 4            | 300 | 1   |
| 4/5         | 5            | 150 | 1   |

These figures may change depending on the games economic balance. The RAP and SGN require per forge can change.

## **Genetics**

Swords has 4 parts, each part possesses 4 genes. A dominant (D), major recessive (R1), minor recessive (R2), and hidden recessive gene (R3). The idea comes from a well known game called Axie Infinity, and Cryptokitties

{% hint style="info" %}
The dominant gene is what determines the part that is physically present on the Sword. When forging, each gene has a chance to be passed down to the forged weapon:
{% endhint %}

* **Dominant (D):** 60% chance to pass this gene to the forged weapon.
* **Major Recessive (R1):** 24.125% chance to pass this gene to the forged weapon.
* **Minor Recessive (R2):** 12.135% chance to pass this gene to the forged weapon.
* **Hidden Recessive (R3):** 3.74% chance to pass this gene to the forged weapon

## Element Calculation

Each forged weapon has a 50% chance of inheriting each of the weapons element used on forging. So if you pair two different elements then you have a 50% on producing the other and 50% on producing the other weapons element. If you pair both of the same elements, the forged weapon is guaranteed that element.

## Collab Forging

We are pleased to announce that we will have a collaboration forging for those who don't have a capacity to cater to forge.

Players will list their available pair on the marketplace and wait for the other player to complete and meet the requirement needed to forge.

> _They will split in half of the forged weapons._\
> \_\_\
> _The minimum times to forge are incremented by two._

{% hint style="danger" %}
_e.g._\
\_\_\
_A player list a collab pair on the market which has 0/5 and 0/5 forge count that will be forge to four times. The other player will gather the requirements needed to forge those collab pair. Then after gathering the required amount of RAP and SGN, and completed forging they will split all the forged weapon in half. Having each player two forged weapons._
{% endhint %}

## Cooldown Times

We invoke a cooldown time for gifting, forging, and smelting.

### Gifting

Swords gifted under 48 hours will no longer gain rewards from any battle.

> _Having one sword gifted will trigger the above consequence._

### Forging

We have a forging cooldown to balance the growth of swords.

> _Every forge count will increase 12 hours of the forging cooldown._

| FORGE COUNT | COOLDOWN (HRS) |
| ----------- | -------------- |
| 0/5         | 12             |
| 1/5         | 24             |
| 2/5         | 36             |
| 3/5         | 48             |
| 4/5         | 60             |

### Smelting

We have smelting time depends on the forge count of the parent. Below are smelting time per forge count.

> _Every forge count will increase 24 hours of the waiting time to be forged._

| FORGE COUNT | SMELTING TIME (HRS) |
| ----------- | ------------------- |
| 0/5         | 48                  |
| 1/5         | 72                  |
| 2/5         | 96                  |
| 3/5         | 120                 |
| 4/5         | 144                 |

{% hint style="danger" %}
e.g.

\
Player will forge two swords with 4/5 and 1/5 forge count. The two swords smelting time will be added.\
\
4/5 = 144 HRS\
1/5 = 72 HRS\
\
So the player will wait for 216 HOURS smelting time for the forged weapon to be forged.\\
